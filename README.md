# my_server
A simple Express.js server

This project is a simple Express.js server that serves a "Hello, World!" message when accessed via the root URL ("/"). Built using Node.js and the Express framework, it provides a basic example of setting up a web server. The server listens on port 3000 and responds to HTTP GET requests. This project serves as a foundation for understanding Express.js and can be extended to build more complex web applications. ðŸš€
