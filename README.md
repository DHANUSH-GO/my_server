# my_server
A simple Express.js server

This project is a simple Express.js server that serves a "Hello, World!" message when accessed via the root URL ("/"). Built using Node.js and the Express framework, it provides a basic example of setting up a web server. The server listens on port 3000 and responds to HTTP GET requests. This project serves as a foundation for understanding Express.js and can be extended to build more complex web applications. ðŸš€


To set up a basic Node.js server with Express, start by creating a new project folder using the command mkdir my-server, then navigate into it with cd my-server. Next, initialize a Node.js project by running npm init -y, which will generate a package.json file with default settings. Once the project is initialized, install Express.js by executing npm install express. This will download and add Express as a dependency. After installing Express, create a new file named server.js inside the project folder and add the server code. The basic server setup includes requiring Express, defining a simple route that responds with "Hello, World!" when accessed, and setting the server to listen on port 3000. To start the server, run node server.js, and if everything is configured correctly, you should see a message indicating that the server is running on http://localhost:3000. Open a browser and visit this URL to verify that your Express server is successfully serving responses.
