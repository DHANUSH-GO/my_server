# my_server
A simple Express.js server

This project is a simple Express.js server that serves a "Hello, World!" message when accessed via the root URL ("/"). Built using Node.js and the Express framework, it provides a basic example of setting up a web server. The server listens on port 3000 and responds to HTTP GET requests. To run this project, install Node.js, clone the repository, install dependencies using npm install, and start the server with node server.js. This project serves as a foundation for understanding Express.js and can be extended to build more complex web applications. ðŸš€
